# Smart Contract Audit Plan

This document outlines the high-level process for a formal security audit of the smart contracts.

## Goals
- Provide assurance that on-chain components are free from critical vulnerabilities.
- Document the contracts so third-party auditors can easily review the code base.
- Make the final report available for public transparency.

## Preparation Checklist
- [ ] Add NatSpec comments to every function and state variable.
- [ ] Expand unit tests to reach 100% line and branch coverage.
- [ ] Cover critical invariants in `test/FuzzAndInvariant.t.sol`.
- [ ] Produce architecture diagrams and developer guides in `docs/`.

## Execution
1. Engage a reputable security firm to perform the audit.
2. Provide auditors with a frozen commit hash and documentation.
3. Address all critical and high‑severity findings.
4. Publish the final report in this directory under `final_report/`.

## Post‑Audit
- [ ] Track remediation work in the issue tracker.
- [ ] Tag the audited release in Git.
- [ ] Include a summary of findings in `SECURITY.md`.
